Introduction:
Gun violence in schools has become an increasingly alarming issue in the United States, with tragic events such as the Parkland shooting highlighting the vulnerability of students across the nation. While gun control debates often dominate the discourse, less attention has been paid to the underlying socioeconomic factors that contribute to this violence. This paper examines the link between gun deaths, economic inequality, and school shootings, arguing that disparities in wealth and resources play a critical role in the prevalence of gun-related violence in schools. Through an analysis of income inequality, unemployment rates, and the conditions of underfunded schools, this study sheds light on how economically disadvantaged communities are disproportionately affected by gun violence. Persistent poverty, lack of educational resources, and high unemployment in these areas create environments of frustration, desperation, and aggression, which, in turn, increase the likelihood of school shootings. By using case studies such as the Parkland shooting and comparative analysis with countries like Norway and Australia—nations with stronger social welfare systems and stricter gun control policies—the research illustrates the profound impact that socioeconomic factors have on school safety. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a comprehensive approach that not only includes gun control reforms but also addresses the root causes of inequality. It posits that economic policies aimed at reducing income disparity, combined with efforts to improve the conditions of underfunded schools, could synergistically reduce school-based violence. By framing school shootings as a symptom of broader economic inequities, this study offers a holistic perspective on how to protect vulnerable youth and prevent further tragedies.

Literature Review: 
The alarming rise in gun violence within U.S. schools has garnered substantial attention, not only due to tragic events like the Parkland shooting but also as a reflection of deeper, underlying social and economic disparities. Although debates surrounding gun control frequently overshadow discussions on the socioeconomic drivers of this violence, a growing body of research underscores the significance of factors such as economic inequality, unemployment, school size, and the social dynamics within school environments. This literature review synthesizes findings from five relevant studies to highlight the multifaceted nature of gun violence in schools, illustrating how both individual and structural elements contribute to these tragic incidents.
Sommer (2014) provides a comprehensive analysis of the social dynamics preceding school shootings, focusing on perpetrators' experiences of peer rejection, bullying, and conflicts with teachers. Reviewing 35 international studies, Sommer finds that 88.1% of future perpetrators had experienced social conflict in school, with more than half facing peer rejection and over 40% dealing with teacher conflicts. These statistics reveal a recurring pattern where negative social experiences play a critical role in the progression toward violence. Sommer’s work supports the argument that socioeconomic issues affecting social dynamics in underfunded schools could increase the likelihood of violence by fostering hostile environments for at-risk students.
Pah (2017) shifts the focus to the economic dimension of gun violence, correlating school shootings with economic distress indicators such as unemployment rates. Analyzing data from 1990 to 2013, Pah finds a marked increase in gun violence incidents between 2007 and 2013, a period characterized by economic downturn. Pah’s findings suggest that rising unemployment and economic insecurity may heighten feelings of frustration and aggression, particularly in disadvantaged communities. This economic lens aligns with the central argument of this paper that disparities in wealth and resources create environments that may exacerbate violent behaviors.
Similarly, Kaiser (2006) examines structural aspects within schools, proposing that larger school sizes may contribute to school shootings by increasing social complexity and tensions. Analyzing 17 multiple-injury shootings, Kaiser observes a correlation between larger high schools (those with over 600 students) and incidents of gun violence. The study suggests that the larger the school, the more challenging it becomes to monitor students effectively, potentially leading to overlooked social conflicts or warning signs. Kaiser’s findings imply that overcrowded and underfunded schools in economically disadvantaged areas could experience an elevated risk of violence, reinforcing the need for targeted economic policies and school funding.
On the political front, Roemer (2023) and Lacombe (2019) examine the response of gun rights organizations, particularly the National Rifle Association (NRA), to school shootings. Roemer’s study analyzes donation patterns to the NRA, finding that contributions surge after school shootings, indicating a counter-mobilizing response from gun rights supporters. Lacombe (2019) explores how the NRA cultivates a strong social identity among gun owners, using gun violence incidents to galvanize political opposition to gun control. These studies highlight the sociopolitical mechanisms that shape the discourse around school shootings, underscoring the challenges of implementing comprehensive policy reforms.
Together, these studies reveal the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors, school structure, social dynamics, and political influences that contribute to gun violence in schools. By examining these diverse perspectives, this paper seeks to contextualize school shootings as a symptom of broader economic and social inequalities, advocating for interventions that address not only gun control but also underlying socioeconomic disparities.
Methodology/Model:
This study utilizes a quantitative research design aimed at uncovering the relationship between socioeconomic factors and the incidence of school shootings in the United States. By examining a range of socioeconomic indicators—including income inequality, unemployment rates, school size, and school conditions—this research seeks to quantify how these variables influence the likelihood of gun-related violence in educational settings. The core analytical tool is a logistic regression model, chosen for its suitability in evaluating binary outcomes, such as the occurrence or absence of a school shooting. This model allows for a detailed assessment of how shifts in independent variables impact the probability of school shootings, offering insights into the complex socio-economic and political context surrounding these events.
Data for this analysis come from a curated dataset compiled from a mix of academic sources, government records, and non-profit reports. Key sources include Pah et al. (2017) for gun violence incidents and economic indicators, Kaiser (2006) for school size and shooting data, Roemer (2023) for NRA donation patterns, and Sommer (2014) for insights into social dynamics among students. The dependent variable in this study is a binary measure of school shootings, while independent variables include school size, unemployment rates, reported peer rejection, teacher conflicts, and NRA donations post-shootings. Using the Python statsmodels library, the model’s coefficients, standard errors, p-values, and confidence intervals will be evaluated to interpret the significance and strength of each predictor, shedding light on the socioeconomic underpinnings of school-based gun violence.
Results:
The logistic regression analysis conducted in this study aimed to explore the relationship between various socioeconomic factors and the occurrence of school shootings in the United States. The results reveal critical insights into how school size, unemployment rates, social dynamics (peer rejection and teacher conflicts), and NRA donations may influence the likelihood of gun violence in educational settings.
The regression model produced coefficients for each independent variable, although none were statistically significant at the conventional threshold (p < 0.05). The coefficient for School Size was -0.000264, suggesting a negligible negative association with the likelihood of a school shooting; however, the high p-value (0.907) indicates that this result is not statistically significant. This finding aligns with existing literature, which posits that larger school sizes may increase social complexity and tension but does not directly lead to violence in the absence of other contributing factors.
Unemployment Rate exhibited a coefficient of -0.140455, which implies that higher unemployment rates are associated with a decreased likelihood of school shootings, although this relationship also lacked statistical significance (p = 0.186). This finding may seem counterintuitive but underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of economic stressors; increased unemployment may not directly correlate with violence but rather reflect broader societal issues that could influence such outcomes in more complex ways.
The analysis of Peer Rejection revealed a coefficient of -0.055573, suggesting that reported experiences of peer rejection might be associated with a lower likelihood of school shootings. However, like the other variables, the p-value (0.895) indicates that this result lacks statistical significance. This outcome raises questions about the direct link between peer dynamics and school violence, suggesting that while negative social experiences are prevalent among school shooters, they do not operate in isolation and must be considered within the broader socioeconomic context.
Teacher Conflicts presented a coefficient of -0.338473, again indicating a negative association with school shootings but with a p-value of 0.427, confirming the lack of statistical significance. This aligns with findings from Sommer (2014), who indicated that conflicts with teachers are common among perpetrators, yet the absence of significant predictive power suggests that these conflicts may not independently drive violent outcomes.
Lastly, NRA Donations showed no discernible effect on the occurrence of school shootings, reflecting a coefficient of 0.021942 and a p-value of 0.877. This lack of significance may indicate that while financial mobilization occurs in response to shootings, it does not necessarily correlate with increased incidents of gun violence within schools.
In summary, while the logistic regression analysis did not yield statistically significant results, the coefficients provide valuable insights into the potential relationships between socioeconomic factors and school shootings. The findings suggest a complex interplay between these variables, where traditional predictors of violence may not apply uniformly across different contexts. This underscores the necessity for comprehensive approaches that address not only gun control but also the economic and social disparities that underlie the incidence of school shootings. Future research should continue to investigate these relationships with larger datasets and incorporate additional variables that may capture the nuanced dynamics influencing school safety.
Conclusion: 
The alarming rise in gun violence within U.S. schools, exemplified by incidents such as the Parkland shooting, underscores the urgent need for a multifaceted approach to understanding and addressing this complex issue. This study has sought to illuminate the socioeconomic factors that contribute to school shootings, emphasizing that gun violence is not solely a consequence of access to firearms or individual pathology but is deeply intertwined with broader systemic issues, including economic inequality, unemployment, and inadequate school resources.
Despite the lack of statistically significant findings from the logistic regression analysis, the relationships explored offer critical insights into the environment surrounding school shootings. The results suggest that factors such as school size, unemployment rates, peer dynamics, and teacher conflicts may influence the likelihood of gun violence in schools. While none of these variables emerged as significant predictors in this analysis, their coefficients indicate potential trends that warrant further investigation. This highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of how socioeconomic conditions shape the experiences of students and the dynamics within schools.
Moreover, the absence of significant relationships could reflect the complexities of the issue rather than a lack of association. For instance, the interactions among these variables may be more intricate than initially hypothesized, suggesting that school shootings are symptomatic of deeper societal flaws rather than isolated events. The findings reinforce the argument that addressing gun violence requires not only stringent gun control measures but also substantial investments in economic and educational reforms aimed at reducing inequalities.
In advocating for a comprehensive strategy, this paper highlights the importance of policy initiatives that prioritize economic equity and improve the conditions of underfunded schools. By framing school shootings as a manifestation of broader socioeconomic disparities, this study calls for a holistic approach to prevention—one that integrates gun control with meaningful economic policies aimed at alleviating poverty and fostering supportive educational environments.
