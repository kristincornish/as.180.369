Summary: The Problem With Counterfeit People dives into some possible implications AI-generated content, specifically “counterfeit people,” and what they can mean for society. As AI becomes more realistic, emulating a human’s tone, it can deceive people in digital environments. If people begin to distrust their surroundings, this new deception topography will undermind freedom and democracy. The author of this article suggests a solution: strict laws and penalties need to be in place to prevent the creation and dissemination of counterfeit entities. He advocates for AI disclosure, which can be done through digital watermarks to identify and discredit fake digital personas. If these measures are not in place soon, there could be a severe erosion of trust that can lead to a breakdown of societal structures.
