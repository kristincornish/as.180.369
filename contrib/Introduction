Introduction: Gun violence in schools has become an increasingly alarming issue in the United States, with tragic events such as the Parkland shooting highlighting the vulnerability of students across the nation. While gun control debates often dominate the discourse, less attention has been paid to the underlying socioeconomic factors that contribute to this violence. This paper examines the link between gun deaths, economic inequality, and school shootings, arguing that disparities in wealth and resources play a critical role in the prevalence of gun-related violence in schools.

Through an analysis of income inequality, unemployment rates, and the conditions of underfunded schools, this study sheds light on how economically disadvantaged communities are disproportionately affected by gun violence. Persistent poverty, lack of educational resources, and high unemployment in these areas create environments of frustration, desperation, and aggression, which, in turn, increase the likelihood of school shootings. By using case studies such as the Parkland shooting and comparative analysis with countries like Norway and Australia—nations with stronger social welfare systems and stricter gun control policies—the research illustrates the profound impact that socioeconomic factors have on school safety.

Ultimately, this paper advocates for a comprehensive approach that not only includes gun control reforms but also addresses the root causes of inequality. It posits that economic policies aimed at reducing income disparity, combined with efforts to improve the conditions of underfunded schools, could synergistically reduce school-based violence. By framing school shootings as a symptom of broader economic inequities, this study offers a holistic perspective on how to protect vulnerable youth and prevent further tragedies.
