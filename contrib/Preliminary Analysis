2. Pah (2017) - "Economic insecurity and the rise in gun violence at US schools"

Analyzes gun violence incidents from 1990 to 2013.
Finds a heightened rate of gun violence from 2007 to 2013.
Correlates increase in the unemployment rate with school shootings.
Indicators of economic distress (e.g., unemployment) significantly correlate with increased gun violence.
Key Metrics:
Rate of gun violence over time.
Unemployment rates.
Economic distress indicators.

3. Kaiser (2006) - "School Shootings, High School Size, and Neurobiological Considerations"
Abstract Summary:
Examines 17 multiple-injury school shootings in the last decade.
Majority of shootings occurred in high schools with enrollments over 600.
Suggests that large school sizes exacerbate social complexity and violent behavior.
Key Metrics:
School size (number of students).
Incidence of school shootings in relation to school size.

4. Roemer (2023) - "School shootings increase NRA donations"
Abstract Summary:
Analyzes NRA donations before and after school shootings using data from 225,000 donations.
Finds substantial increases in donation amounts and donor numbers after shootings.
Highlights the counter-mobilizing responses of gun rights supporters.
Key Metrics:
Amount of NRA donations.
Number of NRA donors.
Timeline of donations relative to school shootings.

5. Lacombe (2019) - "The Political Weaponization of Gun Owners: The National Rifle Association’s Cultivation, Dissemination, and Use of a Group Social Identity"
Abstract Summary:
Examines the NRA's political influence and mobilization of gun owners.
Demonstrates that the NRA cultivates a politicized gun owner social identity.
Mobilizes mass political action using this identity.
Key Metrics:
NRA membership trends.
Political campaign contributions.
Public opinion on gun control.

Preliminary Data Analysis
Aggregate Data:
Combine the metrics from each abstract into a dataset that highlights key variables such as school size, economic insecurity, social dynamics, NRA influence, and gun violence rates.
Correlation Analysis:
Social Dynamics (Sommer, 2014):
Correlate the incidence of social conflicts (bullying, peer rejection, teacher conflicts) with school shooting incidents.
Economic Factors (Pah, 2017):
Analyze the relationship between economic distress indicators (unemployment rates, income inequality) and the rate of gun violence.
School Size (Kaiser, 2006):
Examine the correlation between school size and the incidence of shootings.
NRA Influence (Roemer, 2023; Lacombe, 2019):
Investigate the effect of school shootings on NRA donations and political mobilization.

Comparative Analysis:
Compare the findings with data from countries with different socioeconomic conditions and gun control policies to understand the broader context.
Preliminary Findings (Hypothetical Example):
Social Dynamics:
High incidence of social conflicts (88.1%) among school shooting perpetrators.
Peer rejection and conflicts with teachers are significant factors.
Economic Factors:
Increased gun violence rates correlate with higher unemployment and economic distress.
Notable increase in shootings during periods of economic downturn (2007-2013).
School Size:
Larger schools (enrollments over 600) have a higher incidence of shootings.
Complex social environments in large schools may contribute to violent behavior.
NRA Influence:
School shootings result in increased NRA donations and political mobilization.
The NRA effectively uses gun owner identity to mobilize support against gun control measures.

Conclusion:
This preliminary data analysis supports the hypothesis that social dynamics, economic insecurity, and organizational influences like the NRA play critical roles in the prevalence of school shootings. Addressing these root causes alongside implementing gun control measures could reduce the incidence of school shootings and enhance student safety.
