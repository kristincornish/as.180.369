In my investigation into the complex relationship between gun violence, economic inequality, and school shootings in the United States, I am utilizing insights and tools from Korinek's paper to enhance various research processes. Korinek emphasizes the use of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT to improve ideation, data analysis, and writing. Leveraging LLMs allows me to streamline the gathering and analysis of large datasets related to income inequality, unemployment rates, and educational funding. These models assist in generating hypotheses and providing feedback on research design and methodology. By automating micro tasks, I can focus on in-depth analysis and interpretation of how socioeconomic disparities contribute to higher rates of gun violence in economically disadvantaged areas. This approach not only increases productivity but also ensures a thorough examination of the multifaceted factors influencing school shootings, ultimately leading to more robust and insightful conclusions.
